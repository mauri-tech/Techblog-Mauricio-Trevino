## Project Description
Inside.tech is my first tech blog, created with the purpose of providing a platform for developers to publish their blog posts and engage in discussions by commenting on other developers' posts.

## Usage
As a member of the technology and development community, you can create a user account to contribute by creating and commenting on blog posts. Non-members can browse and read the posts on the main page without the ability to participate.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run the command npm i. Use npm start in the console to start the project.

## Contribution
Contributions to DS Intech are welcome. You can enhance the blog by implementing a search functionality based on topics and by allowing users to add images to their posts and user profiles.
